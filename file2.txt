say you're sorry that face of an angel comes out just when you need it to.
As i paced back and forth, all this time
CAuse i homestly believed in you.
Holding on the days drag on
stupid girl, i should've known

I'm not a princess this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep of her feet,
lead her up a stairwell
this aint hollywood
this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down

now it's too late for
you and your white horse
to come around

baby i was naive
got lot in your eyes and never really had a chance
my mistake
i didn't know
to be in love you had to fight to have the upeer hand
i had so many dreams
about you and me
happy endings
now i knowwwww

i'm not a princess
this ain't a fairy tale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
lead her up a stariwell
this ain't hollywood this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me downnn

now its too late for you and your white horse
to come around
